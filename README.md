The focus of this project is to determine if patients can be classified with having Parkinson’s based on the features retrieved from vocal speech recordings. A dataset containing 755 features and 756 voice samples of healthy, and Parkinson’s patients is being used to train multiple classifiers to see which one can classify the data best. The data will be split by gender and classified using the following classification techniques: Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine – Linear Kernel, Support Vector Machine – RBF Kernel and Linear Regression. Secondly, the accuracy, precision, F1, recall scores and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) will be compared by gender for each of the classifiers, to determine which classifiers perform best and whether it performs better on one gender over another. Lastly, the same metrics will be used to compare the performance of the Recursive Feature Elimination and the Minimum Redundancy- Maximum Relevance Feature Elimination methods.
